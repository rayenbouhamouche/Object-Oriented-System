# Object-Oriented-System

Every UML diagram in the model solution is important as each one models some aspect of the eAuction system. However, the most important diagram is the Class diagram as it forms not only the starting point of your prototype’s implementation but also models the majority of the eAuction system’s structure.

Ensure that your prototype is able to execute the tasks that are isolated in the Use Case diagram. The specific steps involved in executing these tasks are described either in the requirements document or the model solution. Where steps are poorly described you must use common sense / assumptions to implement those steps.

The eAuction system will require a menu system that should be implemented in the System class. The eAuction system will also require persistent storage of data (Users, Auctions etc.) using a suitable methodology such as Comma Separated Value (.csv) files or Object Serialisation (.ser) files.
